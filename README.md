# JassBot-Reinforcement-Learning

# Todo

* Use problem symmetry to sort suits 2 to 4 in the order from best to worst [OK]
* Make the filtering of the possible cards before feeding the features to the algorithm [NOK, we need the complete information, not only the cards which are playable]
* Make new features for
  * each one of the three players do not have any card from each 4 suits
